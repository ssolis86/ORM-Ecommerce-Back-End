## Challenges
I did face some challenges on this assignment as I unfortunately did not complete it to its entirety.  
The following are a list of obstacles I did not complete and hope to go back and finish:
 * Timer does not stop at 0.  I couldn't figure out how to set a floor for the timer.
 * The submit button does not take in the user's information and display the highest score.
